# Pokedex Project with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Description
A response web-dev project showing 150 pokemon! Each pokemon is shown on a card displaying their name, type, and an image. This is the first project where I got to experiment with API's, in this case, I used the Fetch API and the PokeAPI.
